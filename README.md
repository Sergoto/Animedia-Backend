## Project Description
 Animedia is designed to let users create accounts and then be able to explore, discover and add Animes to your library. 
 With such an expansive Anime library out there it's easy to get lost in it all. But hopefully with the user friendly UI/UX design users can navigate their way through different Animes and discover new favorites or take a deeper dive into their old classics.

## Backend Description
 The Animedia backend is there to facilate the Anime library database with the models and support the rendering for the front-end and handle user auth and login as well as data encryption.

## Technology Used
Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, cryptoJS, 

  

## User Stories
  
- As a user I want to be able to create an account and login and logout.
- As a user I want to be able to scroll through the different Animes.
- As a user I want to be able to find out more about the different Animes I discover as well as add them to my list.

## Features to Improve in Future
- Favorites List per user.
- More in-depth show/details page for each anime.
- Search functionality with genres and different category types.
